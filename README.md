## Project Management Application

## Description

This project is a simple and intuitive Task Board application that helps manage project tasks efficiently. The app is designed for teams to keep track of due dates, task progress, and project completion status. Using **jQuery UI** for interactivity and **Day.js** for date manipulation, this project is functional, sleek, and easy to use. Whether you're managing a small project or organizing a complex workflow, this task board has you covered.

## Features

- **Dynamic Task Management:** Add, move, and delete tasks between three columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Use jQuery UI to seamlessly move tasks between progress lanes.
- **Persistent Data:** Tasks are stored in `localStorage`, so your progress is saved even after refreshing the page.
- **Color-Coded Deadlines:** Tasks nearing their due date are highlighted in yellow, and overdue tasks in red, making it easier to prioritize.
- **Interactive UI:** Clean and simple user interface with real-time updates.

## User Story

As a project team member with multiple tasks to organize, I want a task board that allows me to add tasks, manage their progress, and track deadlines. This way, I can stay on top of things and keep the project moving forward.
